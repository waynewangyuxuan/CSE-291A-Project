# Curated Phase 1 evaluation

This directory contains reviewed report artifacts for the unquantized F16,
full-context baseline. Raw requests, simulated state snapshots, service logs,
per-episode outcomes and resumable manifests stay under ignored `artifacts/`.

The frozen plan is `configs/phase1/campaign.json`: 60 distinct tasks, four suites,
two seeds, two attack templates and two suite-specific goals, totaling 600
episodes. Task selection is fixed before examining F16 outcomes.

Every selected result export must retain the campaign ID, configuration and
deployment identity, source run IDs, denominators, unknown/error counts, and
measurement coverage. Partial collection must be labeled partial. Trace review
annotations identify their reviewer and quote or locate the inspected evidence;
they do not replace the programmatic utility and attack checkers.
